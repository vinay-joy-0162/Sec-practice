        Capture The Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity game that challenges participants to solve a series of puzzles, challenges, or security-related tasks to find "flags" hidden within a computer system or network. These flags are typically short strings of text or alphanumeric characters, and the goal is to capture as many of them as possible within a specified time frame. CTFs are widely used in cybersecurity training, competitions, and as a means of testing and improving participants' hacking and security skills.
